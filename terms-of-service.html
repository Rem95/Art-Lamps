            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 1 August 2025</p>

            <h2>2. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
            <p>All content on this Site, including without limitation, all art pieces, lamp designs, photographs, graphics, text, logos, icons, audio clips, video clips, and software ("Content") are the exclusive property of Arts & Lamps or its content suppliers and are protected by Irish and international copyright, trademark, patent, and other intellectual property laws. The compilation of all Content on this Site is the exclusive property of Arts & Lamps. You may not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, visit, or otherwise exploit for any commercial purpose any portion of the Site or Content without express written consent from Arts & Lamps.</p>

            <h2>3. Products and Services</h2>
            <h3>A. Product Descriptions:</h3>
            <p>We strive to be as accurate as possible in the descriptions of our products. However, Arts & Lamps does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of this Site are accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. Due to the handmade nature of many of our products (art and lamps), slight variations in color, size, and texture may occur from the images displayed online. These variations are inherent to handcrafted items and are not considered defects.</p>
            <h3>B. Pricing:</h3>
            <p>All prices are listed in Euros (€) and are subject to change without prior notice. While we endeavor to ensure all pricing on our Site is accurate, errors may occur. If we discover an error in the price of any goods you have ordered, we will inform you as soon as possible and give you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it.</p>
            <h3>C. Availability:</h3>
            <p>All products are offered subject to availability. If a product is out of stock after you have placed an order, we will notify you and you will have the option to cancel your order or wait for the item to become available. Please note that many art pieces are unique originals and may not be restocked once sold.</p>

            <h2>4. Orders and Payment</h2>
            <h3>A. Order Acceptance:</h3>
            <p>Your order constitutes an offer to us to buy a product. All orders are subject to acceptance by us, and we will confirm such acceptance to you by sending you an email that confirms that the product has been dispatched. The contract between us will only be formed when we send you the dispatch confirmation.</p>
            <h3>B. Payment Processing:</h3>
            <p>We use third-party payment processors, such as PayPal, to facilitate secure transactions.

            <h2>6. User Accounts</h2>
            <p>If you create an account on our Site, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password.

            <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>The Site and all products and services delivered through the Site are provided "as is" and "as available" without any representation, warranties, or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including all implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, merchantable quality, fitness for a particular purpose, durability, title, and non-infringement.</p>
            <p>In no case shall Arts & Lamps, our directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, contractors, interns, suppliers, service providers, or licensors be liable for any injury, loss, claim, or any direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages of any kind, including, without limitation lost profits, lost revenue, lost savings, loss of data, replacement costs, or any similar damages, whether based in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise, arising from your use of any of the service or any products procured using the service, or for any other claim related in any way to your use of the service or any product, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of the service or any content (or product) posted, transmitted, or otherwise made available via the service, even if advised of their possibility. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>

            <h2>10. Severability</h2>
            <p>In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service, such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.</p>

            <h2>11. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
            <p>These Terms of Service and any separate agreements whereby we provide you Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Ireland.
