            <p>Once your order has shipped, you will receive a shipping confirmation email with a tracking number, allowing you to monitor the progress of your delivery.</p>

            <h2>2. Returns & Exchanges</h2>
            <h3>A. Our Policy:</h3>
            <p>We want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase from Arts & Lamps. If you are not entirely happy with your order, we accept returns and exchanges under the following conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You must notify us of your intention to return or exchange an item within **14 days** of receiving your order.</li>
                <li>The item must be returned in its original condition, unused, undamaged, and in its original packaging.</li>
                <li>Custom or personalized items are generally not eligible for return or exchange unless they arrive damaged or defective.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>B. How to Initiate a Return or Exchange:</h3>
            <p>To initiate a return or exchange, please contact us at [your contact email, e.g., anastasiafantasiaart@gmail.com] with your order number and the reason for the return/exchange. We will provide you with instructions on how to proceed.</p>

            <h3>C. Return Shipping Costs:</h3>
            <p>Unless the item is damaged or defective upon arrival, the customer is responsible for the cost of return shipping. We recommend using a trackable shipping service and purchasing shipping insurance, as we cannot guarantee that we will receive your returned item.</p>

            <h3>D. Refunds:</h3>
            <p>Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email notification regarding the approval or rejection of your refund.

            <h3>E. Damaged or Defective Items:</h3>
            <p>If your order arrives damaged or if you receive a defective item, please contact us immediately (within 48 hours of delivery) with clear photos of the damage and packaging. We will work with you to arrange a replacement or refund.</p>
